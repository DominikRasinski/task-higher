## Instalation

To install this application 'locally', you just need to download a folder with a name "task-higher-master.zip" and run the file index.html in the folder "task-higher-master".

_Before the installation could generate errors because I didn't test it locally but on a liveserver, thus the application didn't promt any errors
I didn't need to correct the attached files which means that I didn't need to use 'https:' in jquery external files._
